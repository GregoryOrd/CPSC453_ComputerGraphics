README for Gregory Ord's CPSC 453 Assignment #1

This submission was built on Windows 10 in an environment using Microsoft Visual Studio 2019's CMake tools.
In this environment, the cmake generation identified the C and CXX compilers to be:

MSVC version 14.25.28610

To build this program in Visual Studio with Desktop C++ Development tools installed, you should just need
to use the "Open Local Folder" option in Visual Studio to open the "GregoryOrd_CPSC453_A1" folder. Visual Studio
should automatically start the CMake generation since the Desktop C++ Development tools are installed. Once 
the CMake generation is completed, select "453-skeleton.exe" as the "Startup Item", then click on the green arrow 
beside the "Startup Item" dropdown to compile and run the program.

I was also just using the x64-Debug configuration, which appeared as the default for my machine.

This submission was built as a modification from the provided 453-skeleton boilerplate code. To make this clear,
I left the source code folder and executable name as 453-skeleton.
